To create a state-of-the-art time series forecasting model for hourly energy consumption prediction, we'll utilize a neural network-based approach. This model will integrate recent advancements in deep learning, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Attention Mechanisms, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN). We'll leverage Python libraries like TensorFlow and Keras to imple-ment the model.
To improve the model, we experimented on:
1.	Increase the model complexity by adding more layers or units.
2.	Tune the hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs).
3.	Incorporate additional features such as weather data, holidays, and other relevant factors.
4.	Experiment with other architectures like GRU, Transformer models, or advanced ensemble methods.
This is a robust starting point for a state-of-the-art time series forecasting model, but further customiza-tion based on your specific data and use case will help achieve optimal results.
